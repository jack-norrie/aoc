# Advent of Code 2023 - C++ Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) implemented in C++. This project serves as my learning journey into C++ programming.

## Lessons Learned 
* If you know the size of your array use `std::array`, otherwise use `std::vector`.
* You can use uniform initialisation {...} for a clear initialisation that is consistent across different types.
