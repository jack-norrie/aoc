# Advent of Code 2024

## Introduction

Advent of code is an annual event, where progressively challenging coding problems are released on a daily basis on the run up to Christmas. These problems usually have a first part, which is used to ease you into the problem, and a more challenging second part. This serves as a fun challenge and a good opportunity to learn a new language.
