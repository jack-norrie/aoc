## Advent of Code

This year I decided to use [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024) as an opportunity to practice and learn C++. My main resource for actually learning the syntax of the language was [learncpp](https://www.learncpp.com/).

## Lessons Learned

### Day 1

* `g++ file_path.cpp -o file_path` to compile to binaries.
* `./file_path` to run binaries.
* In C++ `unordered_map` is a hash map, not `map`, which is instead a red black tree.
* Basic file I/O using std::ifstream and string manipulation.

### Day 2

* Within the context of streams `<<` is insertion and `>>` is extraction.
* In C++ most things are not hashable by default, this means that if you want to memoise function arguments
  you should reconstruct the arguments into some user defined type which implements a hashing function.
* Bit manipulation can be used to create efficient composite keys.
* std::tuple provides a convenient way to group related values.

### Day 3

* I learnt a useful parsing pattern where you alternate between a "enabled" and "disabled" mode within a while loop.
* Using const references (`const std::string&`) improves performance by avoiding unnecessary copying.
* String parsing requires careful boundary checking and state management.

### Day 4

* If you know the size of your array use `std::array`, otherwise use `std::vector`.
* You can use uniform initialisation {...} for a clear initialisation that is consistent across different types.

### Day 5

* You can use a combination of `stringstream` and `getline(stream, tmp, <delimiter>)` to iterate through some delimited data. When no delimiter is passed the default behaviour is deliminate by lines.
* You can use the pattern `for (item : iterator)` to iterate over the items in an iterator.
* The interface for getting elements from an unordered map changes depending if the unordered map is constant or not. If constant you cannot use `[key]` since this by default will populate the map with a default value if teh `key` is not present.
* Some useful `map` methods like `contains()` are not available below `c++20`, make sure to add `-std=c++23` to your compile command.

### Day 6

* A trick to make int tuple hashes is to xor the tuple elements. Although you should bit shift each index, else hash(x, y) == hash(y, x), i.e. the hash will be permutation invariant.

### Day 7

* When dealing with large numbers consider using the `long long` type rather than `int`.
  * You will also have to use `stoll()` rather than `stoi` for string to long long conversion.
* The method `to_string()` is overloaded with different types, i.e. in the reverse direction you do not need `itos` and `lltos`.
* When possible try to avoid integer to string conversions, this is expensive both from a time and space viewpoint.

### Day 9

* The idiomatic way to convert characters to ints is to do `d - '0'`. This works because both are converted to their ascii values before the subtraction, so the subtraction is essentially removing the offset associated with '0'.

## Day 11

*When passing parameters by non-const reference (&), you cannot pass literals or temporary expressions because these are rvalues, and non-const references can only bind to lvalues (objects with a persistent memory location).

## Day 12
* The return value of `i++` is `i` before the incrementation operation, while `++i` returns the value of `i` after the incrementation operation. Additionally `++i` is slightly more efficient and the returned option when all you want to do is increment the variable. NOTE: This is not the case for a loop, where you want `i` before the incrementation, hence why `i++` is used.
