## Advent of Code

This year I decided to use [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024) as an opportunity to practice and learn C.

This follows my AOC journey last year with C++, which I originally picked so that I could get a better understanding of low level programming concepts as a Python developer. However, I was left a little disappointed since C++ introduces many higher level abstractions, such as smart pointers, that make some of the low level tasks I was trying to learn/practice trivial. That is why this year I am stripping away the abstractions and going straight to C. The learning curve won't be so bad given my syntactic knowledge, but I anticipate that I will quickly have to to start developing my own data structures, which I could take for granted when using C++.

My main resource for learning the syntax of the language will be The C Programming Language. I have heard the exercises for this book are excellent, and as such I will be doing them all over the course of this month. However, one downside of this book is that it is very terse, as such I will supplement it with C Programming: A Modern Approach when I require more exposition.
